# UCLA-CS-32

This repository consists the implementations of projects developed for CS 32: Introduction to Computer Science II, taken Spring 2019 with Professor Smallberg.

[Diff File Creator](https://github.com/ankushbharadwaj/UCLA-CS-32/tree/master/Diff%20File%20Creator): Developed and implemented hash table and associated hash function to produce a diff file given original and revised files as well as convert original file into revised file given associated diff file.

[Evaluate Infix Expression](https://github.com/ankushbharadwaj/UCLA-CS-32/tree/master/Evaluate%20Infix%20Expression): Given an infix expression, convert to postfix, and evaluate the postfix expression using stack. 

[Maze Solver](https://github.com/ankushbharadwaj/UCLA-CS-32/tree/master/Maze%20Solver): Given a maze with 'X' resembling walls and '.' resembling path, solve the maze using following approaches: stack, queue, and recursion. 

[Send Alerts via Medium](https://github.com/ankushbharadwaj/UCLA-CS-32/tree/master/Send%20Alerts%20via%20Medium): Use base and derived classes that represent different forms of digital communication (phone calls, texts, emails, Twitter) to communicate alert messages. 

[Sequence](https://github.com/ankushbharadwaj/UCLA-CS-32/tree/master/Sequence): Create sequence of items of user defined type using following implementations: dynamically allocated array and circularly linked list.
